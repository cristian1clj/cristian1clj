  <h1>Hi there, I'm Cristian Losada 👋</h1>
</div>

I aspire to become a front-end developer, dedicating myself to learning and doing everything possible to achieve that goal ⭐.

Just before finishing school, I discovered my passion for development, which prompted me to pursue software engineering studies. Since then, I’ve delved into researching various career paths within software development, including back-end, test automation, and front-end. While all these options are appealing, I find myself drawn to front-end development.
